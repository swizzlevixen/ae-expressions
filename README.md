# After Effects Expressions

In the [Files](https://wood.boszko.com:2443/bobtiki/ae-expressions/tree/master) area are the expressions I use in After Effects. Some I've developed, and some are based on expressions found on the resource sites below. I've tried to credit the original author, where it hasn't been losts to the mists of time.

## Javascript Resources

Since Expressions are written in JavaScript, it's good to have a handle on the language.

- *[JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805527/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596805527&linkCode=as2&tag=opticalpodcast-20&linkId=7PR5S2O74PUPENC6)* by David Flanagan — excellent reference to the language
- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) has a free online class in learning JavaScript. Many of its examples are tied to the web, but learning how to write more object-oriented Javascript can be very helpful for complicated expressions.
